# Object Mode

MkAPI offers an Object mode that allows you to seamlessly
embed object documentation within your Markdown source.

## Demonstration Package

In this section, we utilize a demonstration package called
`example` to illustrate the Object mode of MkAPI.
This package includes a module named `mod_a` and a subpackage named `sub`,
which contains a module named `mod_b`.

The directory structure of the `example` package is as follows:

```text
example/
├─ __init__.py
├─ mod_a.py
└─ sub/
   ├─ __init__.py
   └─ mod_b.py
```

## Top-level Package

Let’s first explore the top-level package `example`.
To embed the object documentation in your Markdown source,
you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
::: example
```

The line must start with three colons (`:::`), followed by a
space (<code>&blank;</code>) and the full name of the object
(e.g., `package.module.function`).
In this case, we simply use the package name `example`.
MkAPI scans the Markdown source to find this syntax pattern
and converts it into the corresponding object documentation
as shown below:

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example
</div>

!!! note
    In the example above, the green dashed border serves as a visual
    guide to clarify the region of the documentation generated by MkAPI.

In the above example,
the object type (*package*) and its qualified name (`example`)
are displayed.
This section serves as the *heading* of the object documentation.

Following the heading, the main content of the documentation is rendered.
The content of the `example` package is simply a one-line summary:

```python title="example/__init__.py"
--8<-- "example/__init__.py"
```

The `example` package contains a `example.sub` subpackage and a `example.mod_a` module.
A **Modules** section is automatically generated and the `example.sub` subpackage
and `example.mod_a` module are listed in this section.

!!! note
    This is because the `example` package does not export anything.
    If there are exports, they will take precedence.

## Package with `__all__`

A package can define an `__all__` attribute to specify which
names should be imported when `from package import *` is used.
(Refer to "[Importing * From a Package][1]" in the Python documentation.)

[1]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package

MkAPI recognizes the `__all__` attribute and automatically lists the objects,
categorizing them by type (*class* or *function*).

In our example, the `example.sub` package has the `__all__` attribute.
Check the output:

```markdown
::: example.sub
```

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example.sub
</div>

In the example above, the documentation for the `example.sub`
object includes:

- A **Classes** section including two classes:
  `ClassA` and `ClassB`.
- A **Functions** section including two functions:
  `func_a` and `func_b`.

These names link to the object documentation for easy navigation,
if the objects are defined in the current MkDocs project.
A summary line for each class and function is also provided for convenience.

Below is the source code of `example/sub/__init__.py`.

```python title="example/sub/__init__.py"
--8<-- "example/sub/__init__.py"
```

## Module

A Python module consists of classes and functions as its members.
MkAPI automatically adds a list of members.

```markdown
::: example.mod_a
```

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example.mod_a
</div>

## Class

The `example.mod_a` module contains a class
named `ClassA`. You can write it like this:

```markdown
::: example.mod_a.ClassA
```

Another useful feature is that the heading of the object documentation
contains a tooltip that shows the full name of the object.
In this case, the full name is:

    example.mod_a.ClassA

You can check this name by hovering your mouse cursor over the
class name `ClassA` as shown below.

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example.mod_a.ClassA
</div>

## Function

Functions can also be embedded in a Markdown source
in the same way as described above.

```markdown
::: example.mod_a.func_a
```

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example.mod_a.func_a
</div>

## Method

Methods can also be embedded in a Markdown source
by its qualified name.

```markdown
::: example.mod_a.ClassA.method_a
```

<div markdown="1" style="border: 3px dashed #22772288;">
::: example.mod_a.ClassA.method_a
</div>

Finally, check the source code of `example/mod_a.py`.

```python title="example/mod_a.py"
--8<-- "example/mod_a.py"
```

Now, you might be wondering if you have to write all of the
module members by yourself.
The [Page mode](page.md) of MkAPI will assist you.
