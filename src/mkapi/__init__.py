"""
MkAPI is a plugin for MkDocs, designed to facilitate the generation
of API documentation for Python projects.
MkAPI streamlines the documentation process by automatically extracting
docstrings and organizing them into a structured format, making it easier
for developers to maintain and share their API documentation.

MkAPI supports two popular styles of documentation: Google style and NumPy style,
allowing developers to choose the format that best fits their project's needs.

MkAPI is equipped with several key features that enhance the documentation
experience:

Key Features:
- **Type Annotation Support**: Automatically incorporates type annotations from
  function definitions into the documentation, reducing redundancy and
  improving clarity.
- **Object Type Inspection**: Analyzes Python objects to determine their types,
  enabling accurate representation in the documentation.
- **Docstring Inheritance**: Supports inheritance of docstring content from
  parent classes, ensuring that subclasses retain relevant documentation without
  duplication.
- **Automatic Table of Contents Generation**: Generates a table of contents for
  each package, module, and class, improving navigation within the
  documentation.
- **Bidirectional Links**: Creates links between the documentation and the source
  code, allowing users to easily navigate between the two.

MkAPI aims to simplify the documentation process, making it more efficient
and accessible for developers, while ensuring that the generated documentation
is comprehensive and easy to understand.
